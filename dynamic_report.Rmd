## **What's going on with this data?**

The data measures the different observations made on passengers' bus rides. These variables include:

**Bus crowd level** - how crowded is the bus during the bus ride?

**Bus vibe level** - The passenger's overall atmosphere during their bus ride.

The number of passengers not in their seats.

Therefore, this data can be used to see if there's any trend, pattern, or relationship between these variables. I will do this with the help of tidyverse and magickpack via relevant code (finding min, max, or mean) and illustrate my findings via bar graphs.  

## **What I have found:**

The data shows that as the bus crowd level increases, the number of passengers not in their seats tends to increase.

The **minimum number** of passengers not at their seats is **0** for both mostly empty and moderate level, **1** for fairly crowded, **2** for crowded, and **7** for overcrowded.

The **maximum number** of passengers not at their seats is **0** for mostly empty, **1** for moderate level, **2** fairly crowded, **3** for crowded, and **7** at a bus crowd level of overcrowded.

The data also shows that as the bus vibe level changes (level increases), the number of passengers not being in their seats tends to increase. 

The **minimum number** of passengers not at their seats is **0** for average and quiet/calm and **1** for fairly noisy bus vibe level.

The **maximum number** of passengers not at their seats is **0** for mostly empty, **1** for moderate level, **2** for fairly crowded, **3** for crowded, and **7** at a fairly noisy bus vibe level.
