## **What's going on with this data?**

The data measures the different observations made on people's bus rides. These variables include:

**Bus crowd level** - how crowded is the bus during the bus ride?

**Bus vibe level** - The passenger's overall atmosphere during their bus ride.

The number of passengers not in their seats.


## **What I have found:**

The data shows that as the bus crowd level increases, the number of people standing tends to increase.

For instance, the **maximum number** of people not in their seats is **7** at a bus crowd level of overcrowded.

The data also shows that as the bus vibe level changes (level increases), the number of people not being at their seat tends to increase. 

For instance, the **maximum number** of people not at their seats is **7** at a fairly noisy bus vibe level.
