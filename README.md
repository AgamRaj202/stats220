# stats220
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in information and technology management with statistics.
- I am taking STATS 220 because it is one of my course requirements. 
- I am interested in learning about interpreting statistical models/data and applying them to the real world.
